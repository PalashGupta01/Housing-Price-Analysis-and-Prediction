# Housing-Price-Analysis-and-Prediction
**Introduction: Predicting Housing Prices**

In this data science project, we embark on an exciting journey to predict housing prices using a dataset named housing.csv. The goal is to develop models that can accurately estimate the cost of a house based on several key attributes. Let's break down the project steps and concepts for a clear understanding:

### 1. Introduction:**  
The housing market is a complex system influenced by various factors such as the size of the property, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, the presence of additional amenities like guest rooms and parking, and even external features like whether it's located on a main road or in a preferred area. Understanding how these factors interact to determine housing prices is crucial for both buyers and sellers in the real estate market.

### 2. Importing the Dataset:**  
We start by importing the dataset named housing.csv, which contains valuable information about different houses and their attributes.

### 3. DataSet:**  
The dataset comprises several columns including 'price', 'area', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'stories', and various other features that contribute to determining housing prices.

### 4. Data Wrangling:**  
We perform data normalization and binning to ensure the data is in a suitable format for analysis.

### 5. Exploratory Data Analysis:**  
Through box plot analysis, scatter plot analysis, heat maps, and correlation analysis, we explore the relationships between different attributes and housing prices. These visualizations help us understand which factors are most influential in determining housing prices.

### 6. Model Development:**  
We develop predictive models using techniques such as simple linear regression and multiple linear regression. These models help us estimate housing prices based on the given attributes.

### 7. Model Evaluation with Visualization:**  
We evaluate the performance of our models using regression plots, residual plots, and distribution plots. These visualizations allow us to assess how well our models are capturing the patterns in the data.

### 8. Polynomial Regression:**  
We explore polynomial regression to account for nonlinear relationships between attributes and housing prices.

### 9. Model Evaluation with Train Test Split:**  
We split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of our models on unseen data.

### 10. K-Fold Cross Validation:**  
We employ K-fold cross-validation to validate the robustness of our models and ensure they generalize well to new data.

### 11. Overfitting, Underfitting, and Model Selection:**  
We discuss concepts of overfitting and underfitting, and how to select the best model that strikes a balance between bias and variance.

### 12. Model Selection without Pipelines:**  
We select the best-performing model without using pipelines.

### 13. Ridge Regression:**  
Finally, we explore ridge regression as a regularization technique to improve the performance of our models.

In conclusion, this project equips us with the knowledge and tools necessary to predict housing prices accurately, enabling informed decision-making in the real estate market.
